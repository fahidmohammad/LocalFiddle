LocalFiddle
===========

WARNING
-------

First and foremost: Only use LocalFiddle on a local development server.
It is meant to be a quick and easy tool to easily test something, 
not something to go live on an actual website.

Why LocalFiddle?
----------------

Most likely you'll have heard of [JsFiddle](JsFiddle), the great online front-end try-out
and even collaboration tool. 

I love jsFiddle and use it almost daily, but there is one thing that bugs me
about it. Due to its massive popularity, the servers are often that smothered by
the vast amount of requests that it tends to be very slow upon pressing the 'run'
button. Sometimes you just want to try something very quick, and then you don't
want to wait that long.

Since LocalFiddle is, as the name implies, local, you don't have to deal with the
long waiting times, as it will run straight away.

I would like to repeat the warning though: -only use this for development!-
No protection is currently in place against any sort of injection, and to be fair, it has really just been cooked up in an hour or two.

That said, I plan to improve on it, and perhaps you can, too.

Have fun with it!


Planned additions/tweaks
------------------------

- Styling buttons and general layout

Ideas I might/probably will work on
-----------------------------------

- Support for including external js/css files
- Perhaps an option to enable saving fiddles and let you manage them, if you have a database installed
